# Mental-Fitness-tracker

Analyzing this data can help identify triggers, understand correlations between different factors, and enable individuals to make more informed decisions about their mental well-being, and contribute to the broader understanding and research of mental health on a population level.

The Mental Health Fitness Tracker project focuses on analyzing and predicting the mental fitness levels of individuals from various countries with different mental disorders. It utilizes regression techniques to provide insights into mental health and make predictions based on the available data. The project is built using Python.

And at the end ive also deployed the project using flask. For this i made separate 3files - pickle file, app.py and index.html file.
